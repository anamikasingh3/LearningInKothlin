abstract 
a class can only extent 1 abstract class but many interface class
abstract we say it as A=b if it says a extends b 
whereas in implements it is a has abc
interface keeps final value ,abstract may support non final values

interface provides full abstraction
interface is designed to add some features to the app and not for super class 

so basically interface is ablity to define behavior od an object without
specifying that behavior which is to be implemented
